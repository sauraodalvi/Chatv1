## Project Structure

- `src/components/` - React components for the UI
- `src/data/` - Character data and other static information
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions for chat and video processing
- `src/styles/` - CSS styles including Tailark CSS

## CSS Configuration

This project uses Tailark CSS for styling. The CSS is imported in `src/styles/tailark.css` and included in the main entry point `src/main.jsx`.

To ensure consistent styling across all deployments:

1. Make sure `src/styles/tailark.css` imports the Tailark CSS:
   ```css
   /* Import Tailark CSS */
   @import url('https://tailark.com/styles.css');
   ```

2. Make sure `src/main.jsx` imports the Tailark CSS:
   ```jsx
   import './styles/tailark.css'
   ```

3. Do not add any other CSS frameworks or libraries that might conflict with Tailark CSS.
