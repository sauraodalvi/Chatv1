## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Story Arc Tracking**
   - Tracks the current phase of the story (introduction, conflict, planning, climax)
   - Updates the narrative context based on user interactions
   - Maintains story tension and goals

2. **Character-Specific Responses**
   - Generates responses appropriate to each character's personality
   - Ensures characters react appropriately to the current story context
   - Maintains consistent character behavior throughout the scenario

3. **Contextual Awareness**
   - Ensures all responses reference the current situation
   - Makes the conversation more immersive and logical
   - Prevents generic or out-of-context responses

4. **Improved Avengers Scenario**
   - Enhanced the alien invasion scenario with proper context
   - Added appropriate initial messages and actions
   - Ensured characters behave according to their established personalities

## Implementation Details

The story arc system uses a state object with the following structure:
```javascript
{
  title: "Scenario Title",
  theme: "superhero",
  currentPhase: "conflict",
  currentGoal: "Defend New York City from the alien invasion",
  currentTension: "high",
  keyCharacters: ["Iron Man", "Captain America", "Thor", "Hulk"],
  keyLocations: ["New York City", "Alien Mothership", "Stark Tower"],
  plotPoints: [
    "Aliens have begun their invasion of New York",
    "The Avengers are fighting to protect civilians",
    "The team needs to find the aliens' weakness",
    "The final battle will take place on the mothership"
  ],
  currentContext: "The Avengers are in the midst of battle against alien forces...",
  previousContext: ""
}
```

This implementation significantly improves the chat experience by making it more immersive, logical, and engaging.
